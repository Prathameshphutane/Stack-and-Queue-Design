# Stack-and-Queue-Design
Designing stack and queue in Java

# Problem Statement:

Write an interface for a collection with the following operations:

•              Add(number) - adds number to a queue

•              Get() - removes the next number from the queue and returns it

•              IsEmpty() - returns whether the queue is empty

•              Size() - returns the queue's size

Write 2 implementations of the interface - LIFO (last-in, first-out) and FIFO (first-in, first-out).

Note:

•              Use primitive data structures, such as (fixed-sized) arrays or pointers, to implement collections that can grow dynamically.

•              Write unit tests for both classes.

•              Design your classes with reusability and extensibility in mind.

•              You can choose an OOP language that you’re most familiar with.

•              Preferably, write the tests in a unit testing framework (xUnit).
